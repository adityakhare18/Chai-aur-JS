//js ka default behavior h prototypal behavior

/* 
In JavaScript, the prototype is a container for methods and properties. When methods or properties are added to the prototype of a function, array, or string, they become shared by all instances of that particular object type. Prototype in general can be understood as a mould and all its instances can be considered as the car made from it.
