/*
The Stack is a small, fast, and automatically managed memory area that stores primitive values and function execution context. It follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

Stack in JavaScript
Stores:

Primitive data types (e.g., number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint).
Function calls and local variables.
Execution contexts for function calls.
*/

/*
The Heap is a large, dynamically allocated memory area that stores objects and reference types.

Heap in JavaScript
Stores:

Objects ({}), Arrays ([]), Functions.
Memory is allocated dynamically and managed by Garbage Collection (GC).
How it works:

When an object or array is created, it is stored in heap memory.
Variables in the stack store references (pointers) to these objects in the heap.
